## Description

OpenRefine (formerly Google Refine) is a powerful free and open source
tool for data cleaning, enabling you to correct errors in the data, and
make sure that the values and formatting are consistent. In addition,
OpenRefine records your processing steps, enabling you to apply the same
cleaning procedure to other data, and enhancing the reproducibility of
your analysis. This workshop will teach you to use OpenRefine to clean
and format data and automatically track any changes that you make.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of the workshop, participants will be able to:

  - load and examine data in OpenRefine
  - save and re-open OpenRefine projects
  - use clustering and transforms to correct data errors
  - export data cleaning steps as scripts
