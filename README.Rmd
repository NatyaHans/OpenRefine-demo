In addition, OpenRefine records your processing steps, enabling you to apply the same cleaning procedure to other data, and enhancing the reproducibility of your analysis. This workshop will teach you to use OpenRefine to clean and format data and automatically track any changes that you make."

## Learning Outcomes

```{r, include = FALSE}
learning_outcomes <- c("load and examine data in OpenRefine", 
                       "save and re-open OpenRefine projects", 
                       "use clustering and transforms to correct data errors", 
                       "export data cleaning steps as scripts")
outcomes_text <- paste0("* ", learning_outcomes, collapse = "\n")
desc::desc_set("learningOutcomes", outcomes_text)
```

By the end of the workshop, participants will be able to:

`r outcomes_text`

```{r make cff file, include = FALSE}
cffr::cff_write(keys = list("type" = "lesson"))
```
